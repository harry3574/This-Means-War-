# **This Means War!**

## **Introduction**
The classic game of **War** is a game of pure chance. Once the deck is shuffled, the outcome is set in stone. No matter how you play, the winner is already determined by the order of the cards. But what if you could **twist fate**? What if you could **cheat**?

In **"This Means War!"**, you are given the power to **peek** at both your deck and the enemy's deck, revealing the order of the cards. But that's not all‚Äîyou can also **rearrange your deck** to gain an edge over your opponent. Will you use this power to rewrite destiny, or will you succumb to the inevitable?

## **Gameplay Mechanics**
1. **Standard War Rules**:
   - The game starts with a standard 52-card deck split into two equal halves.
   - Each round, you and the enemy draw a card. The player with the higher-ranked card wins the round and earns a point.
   - If the cards are of the same rank, it's a tie, and no points are awarded.
   - The game ends when all cards have been played. The player with the most points wins.

2. **Peek Mode**:
   - Press `P` to enter **Peek Mode**, where you can see the order of both your deck and the enemy's deck.
   - Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to navigate through your deck.
   - Press **Enter** to select a card, then navigate to another card and press **Enter** again to swap them.
   - Exit Peek Mode by pressing `P` again.

3. **Stats Tracking**:
   - The game tracks various statistics, including:
     - Total rounds played
     - Player wins
     - Enemy wins
     - Ties
     - Cards remaining
     - Current and longest win streaks
     - Most common card played
   - Press `S` to view the stats during the game.

4. **Seed-Based Reproducibility**:
   - The game uses a seed to shuffle the deck, ensuring the same deck order every time you play with the same seed.
   - Change the seed in the code to generate a new deck order.
